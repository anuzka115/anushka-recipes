        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>4 cups béchamel sauce (white sauce)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until browned. Drain excess fat if needed.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet with the beef and sauté until the onions are soft and
            translucent.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and black pepper. Let the sauce simmer
            for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, boil the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente. Drain the
            noodles and set them aside.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add a layer of béchamel sauce on top of the noodles, spreading it evenly.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle some shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese over the béchamel sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 7-9 to create more layers (typically 3-4 layers) until you run out of ingredients, finishing with a layer
            of meat sauce and cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly and golden on top.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna!</li>
